Stuff to do after to make it better:
1)write classes that aquire vulkan objects in
thier constructor and release in destructor
OR
provide custom deleter to std unique/std shared ptr

Basically, the tutorial uses c style manual memory 
mamangement (malloc/free)
pallocator lets you specify callbacks for a custom memory allocator
pallocator = null for tutorial purposes, though.
